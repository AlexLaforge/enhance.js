# ENHANCE.JS

A port of [@fat](https://github.com/fat/zoom.js)'s simple jQuery plugin for image zooming – now with support for `object-fit` and powered by [Velocity.js](http://julian.com/research/velocity/) animations.

### Differences

* Removes Boostrap dependency
* Adds Velocity.js dependency
* Supports object-fit CSS property

### Known Issues (todos?)

* Breaks floated images
* Causes content reflow for images without (expclitly sized) containers
* Images seem to inconsisently retain explicit sizes after disposal
* Doesn’t work on `margin: auto` centered images
